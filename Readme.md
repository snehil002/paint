# PAINT Web App
~ By Snehil Kumar

## About
Static Web App to create a 'drawing'  
and save it to our local machine.

We can even choose the stroke and  
fill colors, and change the brush  
size.  

Drawing is made on the HTML Canvas  
element.  

Two event listeners are used:  
'mousepressed' and 'mousereleased'.
